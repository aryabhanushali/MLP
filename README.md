# Multilayer Perceptron
This Python program uses PyTorch to build, train, and evaluate a simple neural network for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset. It begins by preprocessing the images through normalization and converting them to tensors, then loads the training and testing datasets in batches. The model itself is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with two hidden layers using ReLU activation and an output layer with 10 neurons corresponding to digit classes 0–9. The network is trained over seven epochs using the Adam optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss to minimize prediction error. After training, the model’s performance is evaluated on the test dataset by calculating the prediction accuracy, which reflects how well the model generalizes to unseen data. Overall, the code demonstrates a standard deep learning workflow for image classification using PyTorch.
